// DeleteCascade removes the resource type and all its dependants, raising an event for every deleted resource. Returns
// an error when the resources and its dependants could not be successfully removed.
//
// - In the case of the resource being a "Source", it removes its applications, its endpoints and its Red Hat Connector
// connections.
// - In the other cases, it removes the resource itself.
//
// In both cases the authentications are fetched for every single resource and sub resource, and they get deleted in
// batch.
//
// In the case of not being able to delete authentications, we simply log the error and leave them dangling, since we
// might either have a database or Vault backing our authentications, and we might need manual action to remove the
// ones that were left undeleted. In the case of a database it is true that it could be wrapped in a transaction, but
// with Vault that is not possible. What if we start deleting authentications and then some of them error out? We would
// be able to recover the database data, but some of their authentications would be gone, therefore leaving the
// resource in an inconsistent state.
//
// Plus, it's not the client's fault that we weren't able to delete the authentications, so by taking this approach
// the clients don't keep an "unremovable" resource because of some failure in deleting the authentications.
//
// Finally, those authentications are safely encrypted so they can stay in their datastores until we manually remove
// them.
